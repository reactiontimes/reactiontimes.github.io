ReactionTimes
=============


I have made this page because...
=================================
Kaya and I were making a movie about Reaction Times for this competition(http://www.sciencechallenge.com.au/info/guidelines/).
I have done a lot of Python(programing langugage) and a lot of html(thing you use to make a webpage).
So I decided to make a program of my own that Kaya and I could use.
As you see in my Reaction Times webpage connected to my homepage(Swackyweb).
There is a game that tells you your reaction time for that go and your average reacton time.

Are you allowed to use it?
==========================
If you find this page you are allowed with my permmission and Kaya's. To if it to your friends!!
But under the concern that they or you will not still the idea or pretend this yours(It took a lot of effot it making this the video and the proggram).
The reason for this is that kaya and I do want get cerdit for our hard work. When you did not do any thing to help.

How to use the program:
======================
This program reads a file of reaction times (playtext.txt) as comma separated values, one line per person. Have a look at the file.
The program also uses a file (reports.txt) to decide what averages to calculate and makes a report from all the data.

Download the 'report.py' to your computer and run it on your computer. You will need python3 installed (python.org).
