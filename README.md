ReactionTimes
=============

How to use the reaction web page:
=================================
Today we are going to test your reaction times, and allow you to make a game of it by comparing the whole family.
Here are the steps:
To use this page each person just puts in their name, gender and year of birth, then has three test runs and five main runs recording reaction times.
Click the button when the traffic light becomes GREEN.  If you click the button when the traffic light has not flashed GREEN the time for the the traffic light to turn GREEN will start all over again.


After everyone has finished click an email button so that we can have the results for our experiment where we will look at averages by age and medians and other statistics.

I have made this page because...
=================================
Kaya and I were making a movie about Reaction Times for this competition(http://www.sciencechallenge.com.au/info/guidelines/).
I have done a lot of Python(programing langugage) and a lot of html(thing you use to make a webpage).
So I decided to make a program of my own that Kaya and I could use.
You can see this project on github (http://github.com/reactiontimes/reactiontimes.github.io).

You can also see my other projects at http://swackyweb.github.io/ or on github.com/swackyweb

How to use the report program:
==============================
The reports (http://github.io.reactiontimes/reports) program reads a file of reaction times (playtext.txt) as comma separated values, one line per person. Have a look at the file.
The program also uses a file (reports.txt) to decide what averages to calculate and makes a report from all the data.
Download the 'report.py' to your computer and run it on your computer. You will need python3 installed (python.org).

Terms and Conditions:
=====================
If you find this page you are allowed with my permmission and Kaya's. You can deffindly send it to your friends!!!
But under the concern that they or you will not still the idea or pretend that this is yours(It took a lot of effort in making this the video and the proggram).
The reason for this is that kaya and I do want get credit for our hard work. When you did not do any thing to help us.

Collecting statistics:
======================
This page (http://reactiontimes.github.io/) allows collecting statistics.
